I recently finished Hades 2 on my Nintendo Switch, including the secret ending, and I wanted to write down a few quick thoughts while everything was still fresh.

Compared to the first game, Hades II feels slower and more deliberate. It’s not as immediately flashy or chaotic, but that shift grew on me over time. Runs feel heavier and mistakes matter more. Early on, this was a little frustrating, but later it started to feel intentional.

What I liked most was how patient the game expects you to be. Progress doesn’t come from one perfect run, it comes from showing up again and again. Even failed runs usually gave me something useful, whether that was story progression, upgrades, or just a better understanding of how I should be playing.

One thing I really appreciated was Melinoë as the main character. She isn’t as easygoing or humorous as Zagreus, but that contrast works in her favor. Her energy is quieter and more focused, driven by commitment rather than rebellion. She’s born into a specific role and at least initially, doesn’t question it.

What stood out to me is how her outlook subtly changes as the game progresses. With each run, her conversations evolve. She starts engaging more casually with the very bosses she once treated as obstacles, even having thoughtful or almost familiar exchanges with them. That gradual shift made her feel grounded not through jokes, but through growth.

That said, the pacing won’t work for everyone. Some runs felt long, and the sense of momentum isn’t as explosive as in the original Hades. If you’re expecting constant dopamine, this game might feel restrained at times.

Overall, I really liked Hades II. It didn’t hook me instantly, but it stayed with me, and by the time I reached the end, I genuinely appreciated what it was trying to do.

**Final rating: 9/10.**  
A thoughtful, patient game that rewards commitment and respects your time.
