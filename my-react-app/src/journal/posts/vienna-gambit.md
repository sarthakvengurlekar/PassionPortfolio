It's the Vienna.

## Why I picked up the Vienna

Almost everyone who starts playing chess learns **1.e4 e5 2.Nf3**.  
When I started understanding basic opening concepts around 600 ELO, I wanted to play something aggressive without memorizing a million lines. The Vienna Gambit fit perfectly.

I remember watching a 15-minute GothamChess YouTube video on the Vienna Gambit, and I’ve basically spammed this opening as white for the last ~2,500 games since.

What I liked about the Vienna:
- I still get **open e-pawn games**
- Early opening traps that surprisingly 80% of the players fall for (under 1000)
- Early initiative
- Most opponents, even higher rated ones, clearly *don’t know the theory*

I will write another Journal entry this week explaining a few trappy lines in this opening. Stay tuned!
