I am travelling to India for a short vacation. It's a Friday, yesterday was Christmas. I am in office and I have no motivation. My flight is at 11.40 PM, I will go to the airport straight from office. Maybe have a beer, do some shopping for my parents, and rest.

Really don't feel like coding, or even studying. Just glad to take a break next week. I will still work a little bit on a few projects I am building on this website, but mostly take it easy.

I will write a post covering a few lines with the Vienna opening, and maybe something with black like the Caro Kann.

I also have to start working on Brickbreaker.

Slowly and steadily, don't want to burn myself out.

Happy holidays!
