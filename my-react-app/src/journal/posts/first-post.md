summary: Setting up the Journal section of my portfolio.

## What is this

My first ever Journal post. Writing it on VS Code using markdown. Just making sure my Journal section works end to end. If someone on the internet is reading this, E33 is the goat. Go play it.

## What I want this Journal to be

Not too techy. Yes this is a portfolio website but I want my posts to be more personal about the things that I am excited about, not random "How to create xyz using JavaScript in 20 seconds".

## Next steps

Once this works, I'll start adding real posts regularly.
