I have a roommate who works at the Museum of the Future, and she gave me two passes. I went yesterday with a friend.

After getting off at Emirates Towers metro station, we stepped outside to grab something to eat. We unexpectedly came across a small Christmas fair nearby and ended up having pizza there. It was cozy, lively, and a nice way to start the day.

Since DIFC was close by, we decided to walk over and explore a bit. My friend is an artist and loves visiting art exhibits, so we checked out a couple of galleries there. I’m always intrigued by art and the exhibits were interesting and fun to walk through. I’m sure my friend enjoyed that part the most.

After DIFC, we finally headed to the museum.

The Museum of the Future is designed as a themed journey spanning five floors, with one floor dedicated to children aged 10 and under. Visitors are taken to the topmost floor first, which is themed around the International Space Station. Unfortunately, this section felt underwhelming. The concepts didn’t feel particularly futuristic, and much of it seemed outdated and not very engaging.

The remaining floors felt more like carefully packaged gimmicks than meaningful explorations of the future. There were a few exhibits that stood out and were genuinely interesting, but overall, the experience didn’t live up to the hype surrounding the museum.

For a place built around the idea of “the future,” I expected bolder ideas, stronger storytelling, and more imagination.

**Final rating: 4/10.**  
They could have done a lot more with such a powerful theme, but it ultimately fell short.
